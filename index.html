										<div class="col-md-3"><span>Java(4 Years)</span><p>Java was the first programming language that I did learn. Since freshman year of college I have used java for most of my coursework. Java introduced me to Objects, Inheritance, MVC, Abstraction, and Encapsulation techniques.</p></div>
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>JavaScript/JQuery/Ajax/RESTful Interfaces(2 Years)</span><p>I started using JavaScript when I began programming in Unity. In Unity everything was programmed through JavaScript with classes and objects etc. Dynamic typing is marvelous. I went on to take an advanced WWW Programming class where I learned to incorporate the JavaScript framework, JQuery, and utilize its simple Ajax calls to PHP scripts to enable data passing to MySQL databases.</p></div>
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>C (2 Years)</span><p> I began using C in my hardware class where we would write up programs in C to convert to Instruction code. I never had any formal introduction to C, and thus was required to learn it on my own through online resources. I then began using C more extensively in operating systems where we were required to implement semaphores, monitors, and Linux pipelines. Which will all be found on my github.</p></div>
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>Unity Game Engine (1 Year)</span><p>I enrolled into a Game Design class at UNC where our final project was to write up and develop a full game. I created Ascensions  Island with Unity, importing models, writing scripts through JavaScript, triggering events during trigger points in regards to user interactions.</p></div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>HTML (6 Years)</span><p>I've been using HTML since I was 12, writing small, ugly websites and playing around with headers and such. I then began to realize how to utilize HTML with JavaScript, CSS, and PHP after I got a understanding of how general computer languages work and began implementing my skills with the addition of taking web design classes at UNC. This website will hopefully prove how I've come along the past years with the utilization of HTML5 and the development of this website.</p></div>
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>CSS (4 years)</span><p>I've been using CSS since my first web design course freshman year of college. It does wonders and I've firmly learned the inner workings of adjustments to margins, paddings, and small tricks to incorporate JavaScript ideas. With the help of the bootstrap framework, page layout design has become a painless process.</p></div>
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>PHP(1 Year)</span><p>I only recently started using PHP as I really did not know anything about server-side programming till I took my advanced web design course. Only now have I realized the true power of PHP coupled with MySQL and JavaScript. I've used PHP with HTML/CSS/MySQL to create cookie-based authentication, a secure user-system, logins, image uploads, image commenting, voting, and other tid-bits of web applications.  </p></div>
										<div class="col-md-3"><span>MySQL(1 Year)</span><p>As I started with PHP, I was also introduced to phpMyAdmin and learned about the MySQL language and its incorporation with databases and PHP. Through that knowledge I was able to create databases to hold user data, from a whole user system, to cookies/sessions, and user voting etc. I harnessed  all the power by all these different languages and created what I could have never imagined years ago I could do.</p></div>

											<p>Tarheel Gallery is a website that brings together the fundamentals of HTML5, PHP, Javascript/JQuery, MySQL, Ajax cals, and RESTful interfaces. This website was built for the final project of my Advanced Web Programming course. The basis of Tarheel Gallery was to create a website which we were preferred to not use any kinds of frameworks or plugins.</p>

											<p>I've showcased my ability to work with PHP and MySQL through the creation of a site-wide user system. I integrated a full user system into the website.

Users are able to be recognized through a cookie-based authentication system where only the admins know the name and configuration of the cookie.</p>

In many aspects of the website, from user registration/logins or to fetching data for displaying the gallery on the main index page or the individual galleries for each user, Ajax calls are used to retrieve the information regarding those objects from the server and then the controller interface, usually through JavaScript, which is used to layout these objects onto the Users view through the browser.</p>

											<p>Unity has the ability to be scripted using a number of given languages. We decided to use JavaScript and this project helped further my knowledge of the language and shows my skills at event driven programming. Different objects were created and triggers were attached to these objects through JavaScript, such as an invisible plane, once these objects were hit or passed, they would trigger functions in JavaScript to be executed which gave the game it's responsiveness to user interaction.</p>

Objects were given velocity vectors and weights which all put together created a world that wasn’t beyond that of reality. Ascensions Island further shows the development and understanding of Unity's Physics Engine coupled with JavaScript</p>

									<p class="head">Practically my whole life story...</p>
									<p>Hello! My name is Danyal Fiza. The following story is my self-taught journey to becoming a student of computer programming. 
									</p>
									<p>
										As a young human, I was endlessly fascinated by computers and technology. My fascination can be traced back to 1999, in a little store called “Best Buy.” My family was in need of a computer featuring the capabilities necessary for my older brothers’ school projects. Strolling through all of the Windows 95 machines, I felt so small. These big, gray machines towered my 7 year-old frame. As my siblings finally chose their machine and reached checkout, I remember staring at the large box as if it was a Christmas present just waiting to be unwrapped of its potential. And ever since, I was hooked, or wired.
										Little did I know this Windows 95 machine would be the first computer I would learn to experiment and explore my passion. With 512MB of ram, 8GB worth of hard drive space, this computer roared with seemingly infinite capabilities; it dueled as an engine and my classroom. Fast-forward years of adolescence and computer advancements, I was spending more and more time on my computer soaking up all the new technology and its inner workings.
										</p>
										<p>
										At 12, my brother facilitated my computer science experience with the introduction to Adobe Photoshop. Beginning with the basics, I photo-shopped cars and googled car tutorials, until the day I found myself rapt in the search for website templates tutorials. From there on, I learned HTML code. Realizing that was insufficient education, I was left unsatisfied with the resulting ugly website creations. With the web as my teacher, I was driven to learn more about computer programming. The more I googled, the more I learned and was able to teach myself how to program all the tests and projects from my child to my adult years. 
										</p>
										<p>
										After enrolling at UNC, I admittedly did not know what I wanted to do. Yet, I realized one consistent thing in my life: computers. My love for computers and interest in their inter-workings stayed constant though out my studies. During my freshman year, I decided to take COMP 101: Intro to Programming, and I loved it! It was the best class I’d taken because it fulfilled my curiosity and passions for technology and offered a valuable skill set for my future. As I explored other areas of study (science and business), nothing stuck to me more than the COMP classes. At last, I decided to pursue my love of computer science. Now, I am excited to continue my journey and progress as a web designer, developer, and engineer!
